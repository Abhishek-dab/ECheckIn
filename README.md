# ECheckIn

Digitalizing the CheckIn, CheckOut process via displaying a unique QR code and verifying it using FireBase Database


### How it works:
If there is a session going on and the orgainer wants to take the attendance of all the people attending it he can use the app as organiser to generate unique QR codes. The attendes can use the app as users to scan the qr codes shown by the organisers so that the information is captured by the organisers thus simplifing the process.
